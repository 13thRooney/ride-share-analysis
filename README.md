# ride-share-analysis

Given the raw data provided, the following outlines the analysis of a few clearly observable trends and my suggestions and questions as they relate to the pursuit of new opportunities for market differentiation in the ride-sharing business:

The first glaring observation:

•	There is a clear correlation between the average revenue per ride and the total number of rides per city (i.e., average fare per ride is greater in in areas where there are fewer rides).

Is this because the supply of drivers is lower in these areas? And price is higher due to supply vs. demand? Does price automatically fluctuate in real-time based on demand? Are there potential pricing optimization/automation strategies that could be put in place to optimize pricing relative to supply and demand?

or

Is this because the duration of the ride is longer? If we knew the duration of the ride, it may be possible to extrapolate if the length of the trip had any effect on the average fare per ride.

…or some kind of combination of the two?

A few other observations:

•	Urban areas produce about 2/3rd’s of the total number of rides. 
•	Urban areas produce about 2/3rd’s of the total revenue.
•	Urban areas have about 80% of the total drivers.

If we increased the total number of drivers in Rural and Suburban areas, can we snag more rides and generate more total revenue?

Would total fare revenue increase if drivers were encouraged to work in Rural and Suburban areas? Would the cost per ride remain the same? Would we have to pay more to entice workers to drive in Rural areas? How would this effect margins?

My conclusion is that the information contained in this analysis provides us with a baseline control group “A” and lots of questions that would require more data of which would allow us to make a more informed decision with how to proceed with any further market differentiation testing.
